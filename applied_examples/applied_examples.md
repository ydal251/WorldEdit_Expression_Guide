# Applied Examples {#applied-examples}

In this section we will take some example use cases or ideas, and explore how we might achieve them through using everything we have learned in this guide.

With each example, the final result may appear complex, but if you break it down you will be able to recognise each component and how it works.

As with everything else in this guide, you are encouraged to take these examples and modify them yourself to better understand how it all works.

We intend to expand on this section with other interesting worked examples\!
