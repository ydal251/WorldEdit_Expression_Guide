# Foreword

The intention behind this document is to give you a strong introduction to using Expressions within WorldEdit, a powerful tool that you can use to aid your future creative endeavors.

Throughout this guide we will look into how we can use expressions from the most simple operations up to the more complex noise functions. We recommend reading in order as we continuously build upon previous chapters.

While it is a long guide, don’t be afraid of the page count\!   
We used a lot of pictures and ingame-footage throughout. As well as that, a good amount of the pages are a collection of example commands that we hope can be helpful and interesting for you to use and adapt.   
Additionally we have tried to explain each concept in as simple and inclusive terms as possible, which did result in overall more text but in a way we hope you will find approachable.

We would strongly recommend using this guide as an on-going reference point in your learning, there is no need to complete it in one sitting.

If you aren’t looking for a full step-by-step guide then you can find the documentation for everything we look at here: [WorldEdit Documentation \- Expression Syntax](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/usage/other/expressions/)
