# Generate Command {#generate-command}

Now that we understand the basics of using expressions, let us look into the //generate command.  
The //generate command essentially works in the same way as the expression mask but has a few small yet powerful additional features.  
Its syntax is  
//generate \<pattern\> \<expression...\>  
with aliases //gen or //g. We also do not need the \[=...\] mask notation anymore.

Just as with the expression mask, we can put **1**/**true** as the expression [recalling *Command 1.1.1*](../what_are_expressions/basics/true_false.md#command113), filling in all of the selection.
