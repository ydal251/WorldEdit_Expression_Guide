# Using the Noise Functions {#using-the-noise-functions}

Now that weâ€™ve covered the general idea of noise and how FAWE implements a basic version of them, we can now move on to fully manipulating the various parameters of noise generation to really create the things we want.

At first it will probably look quite complicated, as you can see in one of the previous example commands: [(Command 2.3.3)](../generate/type_data.md)  
However, each value in this function has a defined purpose that you will be able to fully control once you have a basic understanding.
